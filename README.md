Hereâ€™s a simple **README.md** for your keylogger project on GitHub:

# Keylogger Project (Using pynput)

This is a basic keylogger implemented in Python using the `pynput` library. It records the keys pressed by the user and logs them into a file named `keyfile.txt`. The project is for educational purposes only.

## Features:
- Captures key presses and logs them into a text file.
- Supports capturing printable characters and special keys.
- The `keyfile.txt` will be created in the same directory as the script.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library

## Installation:

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the script):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/keylogger.git
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies** using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pynput
   ```

## How to Use:

1. **Run the script:**
   - Open a terminal and run the script:
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```

2. **Log File:**
   - All key presses will be logged into `keyfile.txt`.

3. **Exit:**
   - To stop the keylogger, you can manually terminate the program or modify the code to add a hotkey for cancellation.

## Important Notes:
- This keylogger is designed for educational purposes only. **Use responsibly** and only on devices you own or have permission to monitor.
- Ensure that you have permission before using keyloggers, as they may be illegal in some regions without proper consent.
